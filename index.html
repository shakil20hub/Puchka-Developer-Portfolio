            <p> You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But
                nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning and
                mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development Hero.</p>

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
                developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
                it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
                Hero.
